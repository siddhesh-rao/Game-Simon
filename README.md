# Game-Simon
The Simon game involves repeating sequences of lights and sounds, with players pressing colored buttons in the order Simon plays them; the sequence gets longer and faster with each correct repetition, challenging memory as players try to reach higher levels or scores, or eliminate. I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery to build this.
